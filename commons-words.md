### Can and able to

- For future ability

      We use the form "be able to" 
      Example: I will be able to speak French when I finish my course


- Past Ability
Both forms:

      Before his accident, Ben could jump very high
      Before his accident, Ben was able to jump very high


Although she had lost a lot of blood,
the doctors were able to save her

Despite the difficult conditions, the surgeons
managed to save the patient
They succeeded in saving the patient

- Conditional ability
To talk about a hypothetical ability in the past,
we usually use could + have + past participle 
or would be able to

If I had studied harder, I could have passed the exam
Even if he'd been taller, he
wouldn't have been able to reach the shelf
